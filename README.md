# 🌐eCitizenBill-Platform

## 📝 Overview

**eCitizenBill** is a comprehensive web-based platform that revolutionizes the management and payment of various municipal services for both rural and urban areas. Specifically designed for the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) development, this platform offers a seamless digital interface for managing, tracking, and paying multiple bills related to services such as property tax, water charges, electricity bills, and waste management.

Currently, there is no single website that allows payment of all GHMC and municipal bills. Most people have to stand in queues for an entire day to pay their bills. To address this issue, we created **eCitizenBill**. By integrating all payments for GHMC, rural, urban, and municipal services into one seamless website, we aim to make it easier for users to handle their dues in one place.

The solution also incorporates geospatial data to enhance infrastructure management, enabling better decision-making and efficient resource allocation for both urban and rural municipalities. Municipal authorities will manage the bills and send notifications to users if payments are due, ensuring timely reminders and efficient payment processes.
